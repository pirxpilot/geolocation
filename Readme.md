geo.get(function(err, position) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log('Position is:', position);
  } else {
    console.log('Position unknown:', err.message);
  }
});

```

### watch

Watch current device location and periodically emit position event.

```javascript
var geo = require('geolocation')();

geo
  .on('position', function(position) {
    console.log('Position is:', position);
  })
  .on('error', function(err) {
    console.log('Position unknown:', err.message);
  })
  .maxAge(45 * 1000)
  .timeout(30 * 1000)
  .highAccuracy(true)
  .watch();

```
